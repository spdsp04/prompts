1.2 Data Cleaning

Out of 15 if The learner has to do the data cleaning operations like filtering text, removing missing values &amp; renaming column headers.

1.3 Data Preprocessing

Out of 15 if Data pre-processing steps are done using statistical operations like Lemmatization & POS tagging.

1.4 Data Visualisation

Out of 15 if The learner has done the visualisation steps for finding the word count distribution & n-gram distribution.
