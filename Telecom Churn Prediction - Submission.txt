Telecom Churn Prediction - Submission


For the given attachment, please score based on below mentioned guidelines. Given improvement advise if possible and reason if marks are deducted. 



1.1 All important data quality checks are performed and inconsistent/missing data is handled appropriately.



(out of 10) if Has identified the different types of variables (numeric, categorical and date)



(out of 10) 100% if student has identified number (or percentage) of missing values 0% if student didn't identify missing values. Has imputed missing values in numeric and categorical columns



(out of 20) 100% if imputed missing values as follows: - Impute with '0' in the numeric columns 'total_rech_data_', 'av_rech_amt_data_' - Imputed missing values by '-1' (or any other dummy value) in categorical columns and - Impute by either mean/median in the remaining numeric columns or delete the rows corresponding to missing values in these other numeric columns 50% if they have just imputed missing values with '0' in 'total_rech_data_', 'av_rech_amt_data_' but not imputed missing values in other columns. 0% if he has not imputed the missing values in any column at all or if he has dropped all the rows where missing values are present.





1.2 Filtering high-value customers



(out of 15) if Have filtered the high-value customers correctly. 100% marks if they have used total recharge amount of month six and seven and then selected top 30% customers based on this amount. 50% marks if they use total recharge amount of either sixth or seventh month but not both to select top 30% customers. 0% marks if they have used total recharge amount of months other than the sixth and seventh month and then filtered top 30% customers suing this amount Note: To calculate total recharge amount, student should use the columns 'total_rech_amt_', 'total_rech_data_' and 'av_rech_amt_data_'. It is also fine if he uses just 'total_rech_amt_' column and not the 'total_rech_data_' or 'av_rech_amt_data_' (award 100% in this case too). But, give 0% marks if they haven't used either of these columns to filter customers.



1.3 Tag churners



(out of 10) if Have tagged each customer as a churner and non-churner based on their usage pattern in the ninth month



(Out of 5) Have deleted all the variables that relate to the ninth month

100% if they have deleted all the variables that belong to 9th month (variables that have 9 at the end) E.g. - total_ic_mou_9, roam_ic_mou_9, etc. else 0%



1.4 Feature engineering



(Out of 20) Have derived new features as a part of feature engineering

100% if they have derived at least three new features (these features should be different from the ones that were created while filtering customers and tagging churners) 50% if they have derived less than or equal to two new features 25% if they have derived one new feature 0% if no new features are derived 



1.5 EDA and plots



(Out of 15) Have conducted exploratory analysis using plots/summary statistics to find useful business insights

100% if they have done univariate analysis and bivariate analysis using plots and summary tables 50% if they have done either univariate or bivariate analysis using plots and summary tables 0% if they haven't made plots and summary tables



2.1 Data sampling

(out of 10) Has correctly sampled train and test data

100% if they have properly divided the data into training and testing set and maintained the same ratio of churners in both the sets else 50% don't give 0% marks



2.2 Preprocessing

(out of 15) Has correctly preprocessed the numerical and categorical data

100% if they have scaled (numeric variables) and created dummy variables (for categorical variables) 50% if they haven't scaled (numeric variables) or created dummy variables (for categorical variables) don't give 0%



2.3 Model building

(Out of 30) Has built at least three predictive models (machine learning + deep learning) 

100% if student has built at least three predictive models (machine learning + deep learning) 50% if student has built only a single model 0% if student hasn't built any predictive model 



(out of 20) Has handled class imbalance

100% if they have used any sampling technique or if they have generated synthetic features using techniques such as under sampling or oversampling to handle class imbalance OR if they have used the parameter 'class_weight' inside the train function to handle class imbalance (if they use the 'class_weight" parameter, they should choose a ratio other than a 50:50 ratio for the target class, or they should use 'class_weight' = 'balanced') 0% if they haven't done anything about class imbalance or if they have mentioned the 'class_weight' parameter but used a 50:50 class weight for both classes. 



2.4 Model evaluation

(Out of 10) Has evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics

100% if the student has evaluated the models on test or validation set and reported the performance of the model using a metric other than 'accuracy' 50% if student evaluated the models on test or validation set using the metric 'accuracy' 10% if he evaluated the models on training set only and didn't evaluate model on a separate test/validation set 0% if student didn't evaluate the models at all



2.5 Hyperparameter Tuning

(Out of 20) Has done hyperparameter tuning correctly for the choice of model

100% if student has tuned hyperparameters using the functions GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV or an equivalent technique and chosen best parameters of the model. Tuning should be done to optimize a metric other than 'accuracy'. 50% if they tune hyperparameters but to optimize the 'accuracy' metric. 0% if they didn't use hyperparameter tuning at all" 



3.1 Identify important churn indicators

(Out of 25) Has created a model to understand feature importance and identified important variables

Has created a model to understand feature importance and identified important variables



3.2 Compute misclassification cost

(Out of 25) Has estimated the impact of the final model using misclassification costs

100% if they have estimated the impact of the final model by computing misclassification cost on the training and validation sets 50% if they have computed misclassification cost only on the training set 0% if they haven't computed misclassification cost at all



3.3 Business recommendations

(Out of 25) Has provided a list of actions that needs to be taken by the business

100% if there are more than two unique actionable points recommended by the student to the business based on the analysis and the models that the student has created, i.e. the recommendations should be backed by evidence. 50% if there is only one recommendation based on the analysis and the model. 0% if there are no recommendations



4.1 Code readability

(Out of 9) Has written well commented code

100% if the code is appropriately commented 50% if code is not commented properly 0% if there are no comments



4.2 Code conciseness

(Out of 6) Has written short code wherever possible

100% if student has avoided the use of 'for' loops where vector operations could be used 50% if student has used a lot of 'for' loops where vector operations could have been used Please don't give 0%
